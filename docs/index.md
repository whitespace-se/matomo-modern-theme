Modern is maintained by usability and accessibility specialists at Whitespace agency.

The Modern design is focused on usability and accessibility. Colours are selected to maintain a good contrast ratio. The navigation design is updated to improve focus on the main content. Support for keyboard navigation is enhanced, compared to the default Matomo interface.

The Modern theme has a neutral white header. This makes it a good choice if you are looking to rebrand your Matomo instance, and upload your organization’s logo.
