# Modern

## Description

Modern gives the Matomo interface a minimalist design with an updated colour scheme.

Modern makes it easier than ever to stay on brand. The white header means that you can simply upload your organisation’s logo – without clashing with the original Matomo header colour.

The design is focused on usability and accessibility. Colours are selected to maintain a good contrast ratio. The navigation design is updated to improve focus on the main content. Support for keyboard navigation is enhanced, compared to the default Matomo interface.

Modern is maintained by usability and accessibility specialists at the [Whitespace agency](https://whitespace.se).
